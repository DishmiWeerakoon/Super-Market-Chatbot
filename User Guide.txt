KMart Chatbot User Guide


1. Greetings and Shopping Initiation
  When you start the chatbot, it will greet you and ask for your name.
  It will then inquire if you are looking to do some shopping.
2. Shopping Queries
  You can ask the chatbot about the shelf numbers of various goods available in KMart.
  Examples of goods include bread, milk, eggs, butter, cheese, rice, pasta, etc.
  You can input your queries in natural language. Make sure to add the word shelf/shelves 
in the query. (e.g., "What is the shelf number of milk?").
3. Responses
  The chatbot will respond with the shelf numbers of the requested items.
  If it cannot find the requested item, it will suggest asking a staff member for assistance.
4. Interaction
  The chatbot will engage in a conversation, responding to your inputs until you decide 
to exit.
  You can exit the conversation by typing keywords such as "quit," "exit," "bye," etc.
5. Features
  Case  Insensitivity:  The  chatbot  handles  inputs  case-insensitively,  so  "Bread"  and 
"bread" will be treated the same.

to clarify.
6. Exiting
  You can end the conversation at any time by typing one of the exit commands.
